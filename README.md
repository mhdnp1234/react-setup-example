## React Redux Saga Boilerplate v1.0.0

+ [React] (https://reactjs.org/)
+ [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
+ [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org)
+ [Immutable] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable)
+ [Webpack] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
+ [Jest] (https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

This boilerplate has been created using pluralsight tutorial but with a revised technology stack. The idea to create this is to give a easy start for new web developer.
The tech stack has been in practice for a while and so it saves lot of time for new developer to do R&D. This is still in development and would be improved by the time to keep the process easy.
